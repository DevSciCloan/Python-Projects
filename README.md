### Phonebook
 >This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.

### File Transfer
>This project uses Tkinter to generate a GUI where the user can select a source and destination folder for file transfers. The files that have been modified or created on the same day as the file transfer is initiated will be transfered. All other files will be ignored.

### Checkbook
>This project is a web based application created with Django and sqlite3. It will allow the user to create a checking account where they can make deposits and withdrawals.
